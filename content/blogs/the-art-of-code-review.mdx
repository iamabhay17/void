# The Art of Code Review

Code review is more than just catching bugs—it's about knowledge sharing, maintaining code quality, and building better software together.

## The Purpose of Code Review

After reviewing thousands of pull requests, I've found that effective code reviews serve multiple purposes:

1. **Knowledge transfer** — Spreading understanding across the team
2. **Bug prevention** — Catching issues before they reach production
3. **Code quality** — Maintaining consistent standards
4. **Mentorship** — Helping engineers grow

## What to Look For

When reviewing code, focus on these key areas:

### Logic & Correctness

```typescript
// ❌ Bug: Off-by-one error
for (let i = 0; i <= items.length; i++) {
  process(items[i]); // Will access undefined
}

// ✅ Fixed
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  process(items[i]);
}
```

### Error Handling

Always ensure errors are properly handled:

```typescript
// ❌ Silent failures
async function fetchUser(id: string) {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch {
    return null; // What went wrong?
  }
}

// ✅ Proper error handling
async function fetchUser(id: string) {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
    return { data: response.data, error: null };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to fetch user ${id}:`, error);
    return {
      data: null,
      error: error instanceof Error ? error : new Error("Unknown error"),
    };
  }
}
```

### Performance Considerations

Watch for unintentional performance issues:

```typescript
// ❌ N+1 queries in a loop
const usersWithPosts = await Promise.all(
  users.map(async (user) => ({
    ...user,
    posts: await fetchPosts(user.id), // Query per user
  })),
);

// ✅ Batch query
const allPosts = await fetchPostsForUsers(users.map((u) => u.id));
const usersWithPosts = users.map((user) => ({
  ...user,
  posts: allPosts.filter((p) => p.userId === user.id),
}));
```

## How to Give Feedback

The way you communicate matters as much as what you say:

| Instead of             | Try                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| "This is wrong"        | "I think this might cause X because…"              |
| "Why did you do this?" | "Could you help me understand the reasoning here?" |
| "You should use…"      | "Consider using X because it offers Y benefit"     |

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled?
- [ ] Is error handling appropriate?
- [ ] Are there tests for new functionality?
- [ ] Is the code readable and maintainable?
- [ ] Are there any security concerns?

## Conclusion

Great code reviews are a conversation, not a critique. They build trust, share knowledge, and ultimately lead to better software.
